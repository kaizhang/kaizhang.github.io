abstract = {{ Originally identified as a factor crucial for RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcriptional elongation of cellular genes, the P-TEFb kinase was subsequently shown to also serve as a specific host co-factor required for HIV-1 transcription. Recruited by either the bromodomain protein Brd4 to cellular promoters for general transcription or the HIV-1 Tat protein to the viral LTR for activated HIV-1 transcription, P-TEFb stimulates the processivity of Pol II through phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of Pol II and a pair of negative elongation factors, leading to the synthesis of full-length transcripts. However, abundant evidence indicates that P-TEFb does not act alone in the cell and that all of its known biological functions are likely mediated through the interactions with various regulators. Although a number of P-TEFb-associated factors have already been identified, there are likely more yet to be discovered. Given that P-TEFb plays an essential role in HIV-1 transcription, a major challenge facing the field is to identify all the P-TEFb-associated factors and determine how they may modulate Tat-transactivation and HIV-1 replication. Described here is a set of experimental procedures that have not only enabled us to isolate and identify several P-TEFb-associated factors, but also provided the means to characterize their biochemical functions in HIV-1 transcriptional control. In light of the recent demonstrations that transcriptional elongation plays a much more important role in controlling metazoan gene expression than previously thought, the techniques presented here will also be useful for analyzing Pol II elongation of cellular genes.}},

Currently, chromatin modifications and 3D genome organization are measured by distinct assays. An emerging question is whether it is possible to deduce 3D interactions by integrative analysis of 1D epigenomic data and associate 3D contacts to functionality of the interacting loci. Here we present EpiTensor, an algorithm to identify 3D spatial associations within topologically associating domains (TADs) from 1D maps of histone modifications, chromatin accessibility and RNA-seq. We demonstrate that active promoter–promoter, promoter–enhancer and enhancer–enhancer associations identified by EpiTensor are highly concordant with those detected by Hi-C, ChIA-PET and eQTL analyses at 200 bp resolution. Moreover, EpiTensor has identified a set of interaction hotspots, characterized by higher chromatin and transcriptional activity as well as enriched TF and ncRNA binding across diverse cell types, which may be critical for stabilizing the local 3D interactions. The human genome is highly organized, with one-dimensional chromatin states packaged into higher level three-dimensional architecture.

The recruitment of enzymes to chromatin is regulated at multiple levels, including interaction with sequence-specific DNA-binding factors. However, the DNA-binding specificity of the regulatory factors that orchestrate specific histone modifications has not been broadly mapped. We have analyzed 6 histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, K3H9me3, H3K36me3) across 121 human cell types and tissues from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project as well as 8 histone marks (with addition of H3K4me2 and H3K9ac) from the mouse ENCODE Consortium. We have identified 361 and 369 DNA motifs in human and mouse, respectively, that are the most predictive of each histone mark. Interestingly, 107 human motifs are conserved between the two species. In human embryonic cell line H1, we mutated only the found DNA motifs at particular loci and the significant reduction of H3K27ac levels validated the regulatory roles of the perturbed motifs. The functionality of these motifs was also supported by the evidence that histone-associated motifs, especially H3K4me3 motifs, significantly overlap with the expression of quantitative trait loci SNPs in cancer patients more than the known and random motifs. Furthermore, we observed possible feedbacks to control chromatin dynamics as the found motifs appear in the promoters or enhancers associated with various histone modification enzymes.

Second, these motifs are enriched at the binding sites of methylation modifying enzymes including DNMT3A and TET1, indicating their possible roles of recruiting these enzymes. Third, these motifs significantly overlap with “somatic QTLs” (quantitative trait loci) of methylation and expression. Fourth, disruption of these motifs by mutation is associated with significantly altered methylation level of the CpGs in the neighbor regions. Furthermore, these motifs together with somatic mutations are predictive of cancer subtypes and patient survival. We revealed some of these motifs were also associated with histone modifications, suggesting a possible interplay between the two types of epigenetic modifications.

The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5\% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30\% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis.

Typically, motifs are represented as position weight matrices (PWMs) and visualized using sequence logos. However, in many scenarios, in order to interpret the motif information or search for motif matches, it is compact and sufficient to represent motifs by wildcard-style consensus sequences (such as [GC][AT]GATAAG[GAC]). Based on mutual information theory and Jensen-Shannon divergence, we propose a mathematical framework to minimize the information loss in converting PWMs to consensus sequences. We name this representation as sequence Motto and have implemented an efficient algorithm with flexible options for converting motif PWMs into Motto from nucleotides, amino acids, and customized characters. We show that this representation provides a simple and efficient way to identify the binding sites of 1156 common transcription factors (TFs) in the human genome. The effectiveness of the method was benchmarked by comparing sequence matches found by Motto with PWM scanning results found by FIMO. On average, our method achieves a 0.81 area under the precision-recall curve, significantly ( P -value < 0.01) outperforming all existing methods, including maximal positional weight, Cavener’s method, and minimal mean square error. We believe this representation provides a distilled summary of a motif, as well as the statistical justification.}},

Existing dataset retrieval systems lack the capability of cross-repository search. As a result, users spend time searching datasets in known repositories, and they typically do not find new repositories. The biomedical and healthcare data discovery index ecosystem (bioCADDIE) team organized a challenge to solicit new indexing and searching strategies for retrieving biomedical datasets across repositories. We describe the work of one team that built a retrieval pipeline and examined its performance. The pipeline used online resources to supplement dataset metadata, automatically generated queries from users’ free-text questions, produced high-quality retrieval results and achieved the highest inferred Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain among competitors. The results showed that it is a promising solution for cross-database, cross-domain and cross-repository biomedical dataset retrieval.

abstract = {{Distinct transcription factors influence cell fate, including the generation of effector or memory CD8+ T cells. Goldrath, Wang and colleagues have developed a Page-Rank analysis that shows that the transcription factors YY1 and Nr3c1, which are expressed constitutively, promote the differentiation of effector cells or memory cells, respectively. Dynamic changes in the expression of transcription factors (TFs) can influence the specification of distinct CD8+ T cell fates, but the observation of equivalent expression of TFs among differentially fated precursor cells suggests additional underlying mechanisms. Here we profiled the genome-wide histone modifications, open chromatin and gene expression of naive, terminal-effector, memory-precursor and memory CD8+ T cell populations induced during the in vivo response to bacterial infection. Integration of these data suggested that the expression and binding of TFs contributed to the establishment of subset-specific enhancers during differentiation. We developed a new bioinformatics method using the PageRank algorithm to reveal key TFs that influence the generation of effector and memory populations. The TFs YY1 and Nr3c1, both constitutively expressed during CD8+ T cell differentiation, regulated the formation of terminal-effector cell fates and memory-precursor cell fates, respectively. Our data define the epigenetic landscape of differentiation intermediates and facilitate the identification of TFs with previously unappreciated roles in CD8+ T cell differentiation.}},

abstract = {{The transcription factor Runx3 is identified as a central regulator of the development of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells, providing insights into the signals that promote T cell residency in non-lymphoid tissues and tumours. Memory T cells that reside in tissues around the body are positioned at points that are commonly exposed to pathogens, ready to launch their immune response. However, the molecular signals that control their activity here are not well understood. In this study Ananda Goldrath and co-workers identify the transcription factor Runx3 as a key regulator of the development and functionality of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells. They provide evidence that supports the establishment of a residence-fate commitment early during CD8+ T cell differentiation. Tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells are found at common sites of pathogen exposure, where they elicit rapid and robust protective immune responses1,2. However, the molecular signals that control TRM cell differentiation and homeostasis are not fully understood. Here we show that mouse TRM precursor cells represent a unique CD8+ T cell subset that is distinct from the precursors of circulating memory cell populations at the levels of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Using computational and pooled in vivo RNA interference screens, we identify the transcription factor Runx3 as a key regulator of TRM cell differentiation and homeostasis. Runx3 was required to establish TRM cell populations in diverse tissue environments, and supported the expression of crucial tissue-residency genes while suppressing genes associated with tissue egress and recirculation. Furthermore, we show that human and mouse tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes share a core tissue-residency gene-expression signature with TRM cells that is associated with Runx3 activity. In a mouse model of adoptive T cell therapy for melanoma, Runx3-deficient CD8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes failed to accumulate in tumours, resulting in greater rates of tumour growth and mortality. Conversely, overexpression of Runx3 enhanced tumour-specific CD8+ T cell abundance, delayed tumour growth, and prolonged survival. In addition to establishing Runx3 as a central regulator of TRM cell differentiation, these results provide insight into the signals that promote T cell residency in non-lymphoid sites, which could be used to enhance vaccine efficacy or adoptive cell therapy treatments that target cancer.}},

We mapped candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and linked them to putative target genes. We identified distal cCREs with age-increased activity linked to SARS-CoV-2 host entry gene TMPRSS2 in alveolar type 2 cells which had immune regulatory signatures and harbored variants associated with respiratory traits. At the 3p21.31 COVID-19 risk locus, a candidate variant overlapped a distal cCRE linked to SLC6A20, a gene expressed in alveolar cells and with known functional association with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Our findings provide insight into regulatory logic underlying genes implicated in COVID-19 in individual lung cell types across age. More broadly, these datasets will facilitate interpretation of risk loci for lung diseases.}},

abstract = {{Bromodomain-containing protein Brd4 is shown to persistently associate with chromosomes during mitosis for transmitting epigenetic memory across cell divisions. During interphase, Brd4 also plays a key role in regulating the transcription of signal-inducible genes by recruiting positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to promoters. How the chromatin-bound Brd4 transits into a transcriptional regulation mode in response to stimulation, however, is largely unknown. Here, by analyzing the dynamics of Brd4 during ultraviolet or hexamethylene bisacetamide treatment, we show that the signal-induced release of chromatin-bound Brd4 is essential for its functional transition. In untreated cells, almost all Brd4 is observed in association with interphase chromatin. Upon treatment, Brd4 is released from chromatin, mostly due to signal-triggered deacetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 at acetylated-lysine 5/8 (H4K5ac/K8ac). Through selective association with the transcriptional active form of P-TEFb that has been liberated from the inactive multi-subunit complex in response to treatment, the released Brd4 mediates the recruitment of this active P-TEFb to promoter, which enhances transcription at the stage of elongation. Thus, through signal-induced release from chromatin and selective association with the active form of P-TEFb, the chromatin-bound Brd4 switches its role to mediate the recruitment of P-TEFb for regulating the transcriptional elongation of signal-inducible genes.}},
